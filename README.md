# Rock, Paper, Scissors!

Attempted a simple visual gameplay of the popular game `Rock, Paper & Scissors`
Wanted to revise the following:
* HTML
* CSS
* HTML & CSS Layouts- FlexBox, Standard, etc.
* JavaScript

The image below shows how the game looks when played.
To play, open the file "Index.html" in a browzer. (It is very basic since the goal was revision.)
